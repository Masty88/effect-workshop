## REQUIREMENTS:

### A way to run typescript Node (with ts-node or tsx) or Bun

https://nodejs.org/en

```bash
npm i -g tsx
```

I'm using bun just because its over twice as fast to run typescript than with `tsx` or `ts-node`
If you want to also use bun you can install it at https://bun.sh/docs/installation

### Install JS Dependecies

```bash
npm i
yarn i
pnpm i
bun i
```

### An editor that supports LSP

Hovering to see types, autocompletion, and go-to-definition are gonna be pretty useful. I'll be using VSCode, but you can use any editor that supports LSP.
