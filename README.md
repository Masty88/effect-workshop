## REQUIREMENTS:

### NodeJS 20

Hopefully you already have this, if not you can install at https://nodejs.org/en

### (Optional) Bun

I'm using bun just because its half a second faster to run typescript than with `tsx` or `ts-node`
If you want to also use bun you can install it at https://bun.sh/docs/installation

### Install JS Dependecies

```bash
npm i
yarn i
pnpm i
bun i
```
